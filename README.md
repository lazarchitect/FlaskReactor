Project to learn ReactJS. The backend is hosted in Flask and the database is PostgreSQL.

The app is a web-hosted board game site, where you can play against your friends.

After being frustrated by the "MERN" stack, I decided to change my database of choice to PostgreSQL in order to learn that as well. Turns out Postgres has native JSON handling. It's also just super flexible overall.

I've also added Jenkins and Docker to the list of fun cool technologies that are being learned in this project. I set up Jenkins and Docker services in Linux, running on local hardware. The idea is to redeploy the application whenever changes get pushed to Github. This process is still in testing and configuration - Jenkins doesn't want to play nice. Docker, however, was a total breeze and is simply refreshing to work with.
