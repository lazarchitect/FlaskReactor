Project to learn ReactJS. The backend is hosted in Flask and the database is PostgreSQL.

The app is a web-hosted chess game, where you can play against your friends.

After being frustrated by a Node/Express/Mongo backend, I decided to switch to Postgres in order to learn that as well. Turns out Postgres has native JSON handling. It's also just super flexible overall.

Playable website coming soon!
