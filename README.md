Project to learn ReactJS. The backend is hosted in Flask and the database is PostgreSQL.

The app is a web-hosted chess game, where you can play against your friends.

After being frustrated by a Node/Express/Mongo backend, I decided to switch to Postgres in order to learn that as well. Turns out Postgres has native JSON handling. It's also just super flexible overall.

Update: added Jenkins to the list of fun cool technologies that are being learned in this project. I set up a Jenkins project on some local hardware and I'm writing this right now in order to test it. The idea is to redeploy whenever changes get pushed to Github.

Playable website coming soon!
